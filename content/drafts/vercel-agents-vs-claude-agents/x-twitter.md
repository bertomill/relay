I use both every day building AI agents for businesses. Here's the honest breakdown:

Vercel AI SDK = build AI INTO your app

It's a TypeScript toolkit for streaming AI responses into React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte.

Model-agnostic. Swap Claude, GPT, Gemini like Lego blocks.

The new Agent abstraction in v6 is a game changer for reusable agents in your frontend.

Claude Agent SDK = build agents that DO WORK

This is for autonomous agents that execute commands, manage files, and complete multi-step workflows.

Purpose-built for Claude. Deep MCP integration. Tool Search so the agent finds its own tools.

The simplest way to think about it:

Vercel = the interface (streaming, UI, frontend)
Claude = the autonomy (execution, files, APIs)

One is a feature inside your product.
The other IS the product.

The real move? Use both.

Vercel AI SDK on the frontend — streaming, UI, model routing.
Claude Agent SDK on the backend — the actual work.

They're complementary, not competing.

Vercel AI SDK 6 vs Claude Agent SDK:

Vercel = build AI into your app (frontend, streaming, model-agnostic)
Claude = build agents that do work (autonomous, file ops, MCP)

No winner. Different jobs.

The move is to use both — Vercel for the UI, Claude for the execution.
