## Caption

Vercel AI SDK 6 vs Claude Agent SDK — which one wins?

Neither. They solve different problems.

Vercel is for building AI into your web app — streaming, UI, model flexibility.

Claude is for building agents that actually do work — execute commands, process files, automate workflows.

We use both at Lighten AI to build custom agents for businesses.

The teams that understand which tool fits which job will move the fastest this year.

Full breakdown on our blog + YouTube (link in bio).
