## 1. CONTENT — "Brand voice everywhere"

### Image Prompt

Abstract organic illustration of interconnected flowing forms radiating outward from a central node, representing a single voice spreading into many channels. Soft sage green and warm cream color palette with dark charcoal ink strokes. Hand-drawn aesthetic with flowing bezier curves and organic tendrils branching outward, each ending in a different subtle leaf or petal shape — suggesting variety from one source. Small accent dots and nodes along the branches. Soft diffused sage green glow at the center. Minimal, editorial, warm. Cream/off-white background. No text, no devices, no screens. Style reference: Anthropic brand illustration, organic abstract art, botanical line drawing meets modern editorial design.

### Image-to-Video Prompt

Gentle floating motion — the branches slowly sway as if breathing. Small accent dots drift subtly. The central node pulses with a soft green glow every few seconds. Very slow, meditative, 4-6 second loop. No camera movement.

## 2. SUPPORT — "Support that never sleeps"

### Image Prompt

Abstract organic illustration of two flowing hand-like or wing-like forms reaching toward each other from opposite sides, almost touching at the center. One form represents human connection, the other AI assistance — both made of flowing organic curves and tendrils in dark charcoal ink. Where they nearly meet, a soft sage green glow emanates. Small floating circles and dots drift in the space between them like gentle conversation particles. Warm cream/off-white background. Hand-drawn aesthetic with smooth bezier curves, botanical energy. Minimal, editorial, warm and inviting. No text, no chat bubbles, no devices. Style reference: Anthropic brand illustration, like two abstract organic shapes in dialogue, flowing line art.

### Image-to-Video Prompt

The two forms gently breathe — slowly expanding and contracting toward each other. The green glow at the center softly pulses. Small floating particles drift upward between the forms. Very slow, calming, 4-6 second loop. No camera movement.

## 3. MARKETING — "Scale your marketing"

### Image Prompt

Abstract organic illustration of an upward-growing vine or tree-like form — a single stem rising from the bottom with flowing branches curling outward on both sides, each ending in blooming circular nodes. Represents organic growth and scaling. Dark charcoal ink strokes with a hand-drawn quality. Sage green accent fills in some of the bloom nodes. Small floating dots and particles rising upward like seeds or spores. The overall composition suggests upward momentum and expansion. Warm cream/off-white background. Minimal, editorial, botanical abstract art. No text, no charts, no graphs, no devices. Style reference: Anthropic brand illustration, organic growth diagram meets botanical art, flowing abstract line work.

### Image-to-Video Prompt

Slow upward drift — the floating particles gently rise. The branch ends sway slightly. The green bloom nodes pulse softly with staggered timing. The overall feeling is of quiet, confident growth. Very slow, 4-6 second loop. No camera movement.
